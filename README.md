# Data Cleaning Process

During the data cleaning process, the following steps were performed to ensure data quality and reliability:

Data Integrity – Ensured accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the cleaning process.

Missing Data Handling – Addressed missing values by either imputing them with appropriate methods or making informed decisions on handling gaps.

Duplicate Removal – Identified and eliminated duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness.

Standardization – Applied consistent formatting, units, and naming conventions across the dataset for accurate analysis.

Outlier Detection – Identified and handled outliers to prevent skewed analysis and improve model performance.

# This structured approach improved the dataset’s quality, making it suitable for analysis and modeling.
